## Git Usage in Development
Regular Commits: Make frequent and granular commits, focusing on logical units of work. Provide descriptive commit messages that explain the changes made.
Branch Naming: Use meaningful and descriptive names for branches, indicating the purpose or feature being developed. Consider using prefixes (e.g., "feature/", "bugfix/") to organize branches.
Documentation: Maintain a clear and up-to-date README file in your repository. Include information such as project setup instructions, branch usage guidelines, and coding conventions to facilitate onboarding and collaboration.
Git Tools: Explore and utilize Git's rich set of commands and tools (e.g., git pull, git push, git rebase, git stash) to streamline your workflow and handle different scenarios effectively.
